# SmartFraudVision
SmartFraudVision AI is a Streamlit-powered tool that uses Google Gemini Vision 1.5 Flash to detect potential fraud in invoices. It analyzes documents, spreadsheets, and images, returning a verdict (Legitimate, Suspicious, or Fraudulent) along with a confidence score and reason â€” all formatted as JSON.

Features:
Multi-format Upload: Supports PDF, DOCX, CSV, Excel, images (JPG/PNG), and ZIP files.

AI-Powered Analysis: Uses Gemini 1.5 to review text, tables, and images with a forensic fraud detection prompt.

Trends Dashboard: Interactive charts show verdict breakdowns, confidence scores, user activity, and more.

Session Logging: Keeps a structured log of all verdicts and allows JSON/CSV export of analysis history.

Privacy-Oriented: Files are processed locally; nothing is stored after the session ends.
